# BotWave Status Displayer For ESP32-S3
A tiny project using NanoFramework that implements the [BotWave](https://github.com/dpipstudio/botwave) protocol to display statistics. It in fact was made using the [heltec v4](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4/), no other boards are officially supported.

## How To Use It
```bash
git clone https://github.com/douxxtech/BotWaveStatus_ESP32 
```

Then open it with visual studio (make sure to have the [nanoframework](https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/getting-started-guides/getting-started-managed.html) extention and to have nanoff flashed) and do whatever they want you to do to get that flashed on your board.
